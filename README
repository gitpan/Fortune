This module provides an interface to fortune cookie databases, as
implemented by the fortune-mod-9708 distribution (which is widely used in
the Linux world, and available with at least the Red Hat and Debian
distributions).

Currently, it is a read-only interface.  If I ever need to a read-write
interface, I suppose I'll write one; if *you* need one, feel free to write
it and send me a patch!


AVAILABILITY
------------

The latest version of this module will be available at:

   http://starship.python.net/~gward/perl/

If you need a full-blown fortune package, try fortune-mod, which
should be available at:

CREDITS
-------

Thanks to Bill Ward <wrw@bayview.com> for adding the code that allows
reading a fortune file that doesn't have a header (index) file.
